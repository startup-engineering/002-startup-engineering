CS184 Stanford Startup Engineering - Background Readings


Why Software is Eating the World:
Internet companies are real, high-growth, high-margin, highly-defensible businesses. Software has intrinsic value, and it is disrupting large swathes of the economy (view article for examples). America offers great universities, a pro-risk business culture, deep pools of capital, and reliable business/contract law. Education and skills are imperative.

1991-2007: Microsoft monopoly, Apple survives
2007-NOW: iPhone, Android, iPad


Internet Trends: 
Internet adoption remains robust. Mobile is still early.
Do not ignore mobile growth, iPad even moreso, still huge upside.
Mobile monetization: 66% apps, 33% ads
Re-imagination: devices, UI, connectivity, knowledge, design, learning, data, sharing, EVERYTHING (view examples).

Make an app (no frills) > Distribute Quickly > Get users > Iterate > Repeat > Lean Startup
Sprint: Product to company
Startups: keep costs low, quick revenue, move quickly, emulate success, ambitious, non-traditional


The Social Network:
CS Degrees were previously theory-oriented. No application.
Transitioning to engineering in practice. Breadth of careers available (job growth 2x).
Tackle real-world problems. Learn skills, theorems, code along the way. Solve the problem. Build something. Learn the skills as you progress.
